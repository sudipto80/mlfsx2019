    "let review = \"Recently I had to fly round trip from Phoenix to Los Angeles. I have flown America West before and have had a few delays before but nothing like what I just experienced. No one should ever fly this airline again until they get their act together. On the flight out I checked in at the gate and asked if my luggage could be checked through to my final destination since I had to change airlines in Los Angeles. I was told that I could not. Later I found out I could have but it didn't matter anyway since my luggage didn't arrive in Los Angeles to begin with. The real nightmare began at the gate(s). A few minutes before boarding was to begin they announced a gate change to another concourse. Once at the new gate we were informed of another gate change, than another and then another back to the first concourse. Once there we were told the flight was canceled and that we were to go back to the other concourse again to try and get on another flight. Needless to say tempers were high amongst the passengers and the gate personnel were no help at all. They must be bullet proof to customer aggravation and complaints due to so many canceled flights. Of course the next flight was delayed also by about an hour. With all the gate changes and the canceled flight I was not the only one whose luggage did not arrive in Los Angeles. I put in a claim and they found it even though it took them three days to have it delivered to me. My return flight went a little smoother, we only had two delays but then after boarding we sat in the plane 30 minutes before taking off. When passengers asked about compensation for all the hassles and delays they were told nothing would be done. I have been waiting for five weeks now to be reimbursed for the clothing I had to buy while my luggage was missing. Needless to say, I won't be flying this airline again anytime in the future. The funniest part of the ordeal was when a passenger started passing around a newspaper that had America West ranked last in on time flights around the plane. Everyone got a chuckle out of that.\""

    "let review2 = \"My most recent experience with America West has left a bad taste in my mouth for this Airline. I know that some delays are sometimes inevitable. However, when it becomes the way that an airline does business, it leaves a lot to be desired. I had four segments to my round trip and 3 of those legs were late. This tells me that 75% of the time this airline is either late or does not fulfill its agreement with it's customers. During my trip, I spoke with several customers and the majority seems to have the same experience and opinion that I have. The airline schedules flights that possibly conflict with their capability of getting to the destinations on time and it would seem that all flights in the western part of the US and the international flights have to land in Phoenix, Az. Why can't this airline have more direct nonstop flights from points of origin to final destination. Additionally, the personnel at some of the ticket counters and at the gates seem to have a bad attitude towards the client. Don't they realize that it is the customer who pays their salaries? I cannot totally condemn all of the personnel as I did encounter two of about ten that were quite friendly and helpful. My biggest beef is with the scheduling and the inability of the airline to stay on time. 3 of the 4 segments of my round trip were delayed. I understand that sometimes this is inevitable. However, with America West, this seems to be the way of doing business. This seems to be true both domestically and internationally.\""
